- Secondary: Countries.csv — Contains country-level attributes (e.g., region, code) used for joining and enriching analysis.
- Join: Performed in Tableau to merge flight data with country details based on destination country codes.

## Objectives

- Combine multiple data sources for enhanced analysis
- Visualize route and destination patterns
- Provide interactive exploration of flight performance
- Deliver clear insights through intuitive charts and maps

## Dashboard Highlights

- Top Destinations by Volume
- Flight Counts by Region
- Interactive Map of Destinations
- Performance KPIs Summary

## Techniques Used
- Tableau data blending and join within the tool (no external SQL join)
- Custom calculations and filters for dynamic dashboard components
- Interactive slicers for region, destination, and route filtering
